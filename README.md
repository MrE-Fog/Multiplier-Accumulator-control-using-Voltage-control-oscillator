# Multiplier-Accumulator-control-using-Voltage-control-oscillator
This work aims to design and implement two blocks: VCO block using eSIM and Multiplier-Accumulator (MAC) unit using Makerchip (converts Verilog code to Ngveri model file). Combining these two blocks will perform a Mixed Signal application as Multiplier-Accumulator control using voltage control oscillator (VCO).
